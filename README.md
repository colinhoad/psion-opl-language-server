# psion-opl-language-server

Language server for the Open Programming Language (OPL) used by Psion portable computers.

## Status

This is very much a work-in-progress project that is being shared for the primary purpose of feedback and general interest. As the language server becomes more mature, the list of features will grow and hoepfully reach a point where I am comfortable giving it a proper release number.

## Features

Provides some sample auto-completes for various OPL keywords beginning with 'E':

## Requirements

This has been written in accordance with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) meaning that it should work with any IDE that supports the LSP. For testing purposes I am running it with Neovim. You can run the language server under Neovim by executing the following simple Lua command after starting up the editor:

`:lua vim.lsp.start {name = "OPL LS",cmd = {"/home/user/repos/psion-opl-language-server/Oplls"},capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities(),}`

To confirm it is running successfully, you can follow this up by running this command in Neovim:

`:checkhealth vim.lsp`

It should show the language server is up and running. You can additionally check the log file generated by the OPL language server under `/tmp/` (it will be prefixed with a timestamp followed by `_oplls.log`).

### 0.0.1

Initial proof-of-concept.
